# Portfolio
This is a portfolio of all my work in iOS development.

I *live*, *breathe* and *sleep* swift.

## Tools and Resources (common across all apps)-

1. Written in [Swift](https://github.com/apple/swift)
2. Use [cocoapods](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods)
3. Auto Layout all the way (iphone 5/5s/6/6s/6Plus/6sPlus)
4. Git for source control via terminal
5. Use tab-bars as primary navigation

##



The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can sign in using OAuth login flow
- [x] User can view last 20 tweets from their home timeline
- [x] The current signed in user will be persisted across restarts
- [x] In the home timeline, user can view tweet with the user profile picture, username, tweet text, and timestamp.
- [x] Retweeting and favoriting should increment the retweet and favorite count.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] User can load more tweets once they reach the bottom of the feed using infinite loading similar to the actual Twitter client.
- [ ] User should be able to unretweet and unfavorite and should decrement the retweet and favorite count.
- [ ] User can pull to refresh.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Custom UI added
- [x] Tab bar created with "Me" and "Home" bar buttons

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

# Project 5 - *TwitterM*

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [ ] Tweet Details Page: User can tap on a tweet to view it, with controls to retweet, favorite, and reply.
- [ ] Profile page:

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Long press on tab bar to bring up Account view with animation
- [ ] Tap account to switch to
- [ ] Include a plus button to Add an Account
